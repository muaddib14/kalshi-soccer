## Technical Analysis

### Website Navigation Limitations
- The Premier League website primarily displays fixtures for the current matchweek only
- Attempts to navigate to future matchweeks (MW17, different months) resulted in redirects back to the current matchweek
- This appears to be a design choice focusing on current/recent fixtures rather than long-term calendar views

### Data Extraction Results
- **Match Dates**: Successfully extracted for all matches
- **Kick-off Times**: Available for upcoming match only (20:00 GMT for Man United vs Bournemouth)
- **Team Names**: Complete for all matches
- **Match Results**: Complete for all 9 completed matches
- **Match Status**: Clearly categorized (Full-Time vs Scheduled)
- **Venues**: Not provided on the main fixtures page (requires individual match page access)
